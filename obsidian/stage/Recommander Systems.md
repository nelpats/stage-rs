"A recommander system is a type of information filtering system that predicts the preferences or ratings that a user would give to a product or item. It plays a significant role in various online platforms, such as e-commerce sites, streaming services, and social networks, by personalizing the user experience through tailored suggestions. These systems help in navigating the vast amount of options available, improving user interaction by suggesting items users are more likely to be interested in." - ChatGPT

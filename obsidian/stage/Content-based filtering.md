 
The goal for content-based filtering is to build a user profile based on their actions. To build the user's profile, we look at how they interact with items (i.e likes, comments...)

### Process 

There are some steps to build a content-based filtering algorithm

- Item feature extraction: Extracting the characteristics of the item.
- Creating a user-profile: Now that we have defined the characteristics of our item, we can see how the user interacts with them in order to build a user-profile. For example, the user likes a post about cars, we now know that the user might be interested. More advanced techniques could involve [Natural Language Processing](NLP).
- The final step is to make the calculations or the link between the user and content.

Goal-driven attacks in the context of Poisoning Attacks against Recommendations (PAR) are strategic manipulations designed with specific objectives in mind, targeting the vulnerabilities of recommendation systems (RS) to achieve certain ends. These attacks are characterized by their focus on achieving a particular malicious objective, which can range from degrading the overall system performance to manipulating the recommendation process to favor or disfavor certain items. The nature of these attacks is highly dependent on the attacker's goals, leading to a categorization of goal-driven attacks into three main types:

- **System Degradation Attacks**: Aimed at disrupting the overall functionality of the RS, affecting all recommendation results indiscriminately. The primary goal here is to deteriorate the user experience and potentially inflict financial losses on the service provider. These attacks do not target specific items or users but seek to degrade the quality of the recommendation system as a whole.

- **Targeted Manipulation Attacks**: These are more precise attacks focused on promoting or demoting specific items within the recommendation lists of certain user groups or across all users. The objective can be to significantly influence the placement of target items in the recommendation lists, thereby manipulating the visibility and ranking of these items according to the attacker's desires.

- **Hybrid-Goal Attacks**: Combine elements of both system degradation and targeted manipulation to achieve more complex objectives. These attacks may employ strategies that aim to both disrupt the general recommendation system's performance and manipulate it to favor or disfavor specific items or categories of items.

Each of these attack types is formulated based on the attacker's specific goals, leveraging different tactics and vulnerabilities within the RS. For instance, an attacker motivated by inter-platform competition might aim to impair the overall system performance to create a negative perception of the platform's efficiency. In contrast, another attacker, driven by personal or business interests, might focus on manipulating the recommendation algorithm to promote or demote certain products, news articles, or videos, potentially influencing the information or products exposed to specific user groups or the user base at large.

Goal-driven attacks are thus a testament to the strategic flexibility of attackers in the PAR landscape, highlighting the need for robust defenses that can adapt to the evolving tactics and objectives of potential threats.

The component-based attack on RS refers to the attacks that targets a specific component of the RS (information gathering, filtering, rating, optimization...). To achieve this the attacker has to craft malicious data $D_M$ to add to the original data $D$. This problem is a double optimization problem, because the attacker has to maximize the effectiveness of his attacks while making sure the recommendation system is still working like intended.
